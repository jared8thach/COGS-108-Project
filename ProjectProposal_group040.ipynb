    "The world has changed in previously unimaginable ways over just the past decade. In acknowledging and attempting to look beyond that, it then becomes clear just how unfathomable the nature of the world's history really is. That however does not mean it cannot be learned from, and this very sentiment is what is really at the core of this project. Our aim is to better understand the trends that played out over the past 50 years by analyzing summary statistics regarding their productivity and the circumstances surrounding that. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(Note: We have 2 datasets as of the project proposal.)** \n",
    "This project will be relying on 2 datasets (for now at least), the first of which is from the Long Term Productivity Database [1]. The Long Term Productivity dataset provides summary statistics regarding the productivity of 23 countries going all the way back to the 1890s. (These 23 countries are the focus of this project for now.) Supplementing this will be the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom of the World dataset [2], which contains ratings for the governmental and economic factors, which can be tied to each country's productivity.\n",

We would like analyze the trends of the variables below, along with the productivity statistics provided in the Long Term Productivity dataset. Using these two datasets in conjunction with each other would allow us to learn about which factors are most correlated, and most important to economic productivity.\n",

To remedy this, we'll narrow our scope to the countries for which there are data in the Long Term Productivity dataset, and do general research surrounding their histories.\n",
